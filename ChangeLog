##### CHANGELOG FOR AEWM++ HTTP://SHAPIRE.SF.NET ##
###################################################


1.0.24 (14 May 2003)

 * Added Rob Eberts patch which changes the size of the titlebar, adds some
   keybindings to switch desktops with alt+number keys.

1.0.23 (15 Apr 2003)

  * Menu correctly gets DEF_FONT (but not yet opt_font)

1.0.22 (18 Nov 2002)

  * Rewrote resize client code
  * A few code clean ups here and there...

1.0.21 (16 Nov 2002)

  * Fixed the focus previous client logic.
  * Added alt key moving of windows (press alt, click on window and drag to move).
  * Rewrote wire moving of windows.
  * More code clean up.

1.0.20 (12 Nov 2002)
  
  * Focusing the previous client in the stacking order was broken so its
    been disabled. This caused a pretty major show stopper when clients
    would sometimes loose focus and a client underneath them would get focus
    and be raised. Looks like this will need more time to fix then one night.

1.0.19 (11 Nov 2002)
 
  * Used valgrind to get rid of some errors and memory leaks. 
  * Fixed up the makefiles for aewm++ and all the goodies.
  * Got rid of some shit like the RPM spec files I don't plan on maintaining.

1.0.18 was never released, it was a test build that had some rudimentary
	pixmapped window decorations.

1.0.17 (May 27 2002)

  * Replaced my linked list with STL List.
  * Code clean up (variable and function names were inconsistent).
  * Fixed bug in partial GNOME compliancy. (Open Office 1.0 now works)
  * Got rid of SIGKILL in signal handler since SIGKILL cannot be blocked.
  * Added SIGHUP to the signal handler.
  * Fix for fspanel not updating its clock correctly.
  * Changed default focus model to click to focus.
  * Appbar now checks the home directory for a .appbar file to use as a 
    configuration file.
  * Added a rpm spec file for aewm++, appbar, ae_fspanel and setrootimage.
    All can be built using rpm -ta (package_name).tar.gz

1.0.16 (6 Feb)

  * Remove key grab for escape key when we weren't using it.
  * Small focus issue change.
  * Fixed a function in windowmanager.cc which wasn't deallocating memory after it was used.

1.0.16-RC3 (2 Feb 2002)

  * Fixed problem with reverting focus under sloppy focus. 
  * Merged in a patch from David Lawrence Ramsey which contains the manual page
    formatting fix, the new icon and rcfile change for appbar, the typo fix for
    setrootimage. Also added more support for NET_WM hints in fspanel, aewm++
    has also been updated to add support for this. This changed involved hints
    for virtual desktops. Also in this patch is a minor change to 
    windowmanager.cc where I accidentally left some code over when NET_WM hints
    were configurable.
  * Added a disclaimer to the README of fspanel so that it states that it is
    not the official version but an updated version with changes by me and 
    others involved with this project.
    
1.0.16-RC2 (28 Jan 2002)

  * Fixed a focus problem when reverting to a previously focused client (ie.
    when you close a client it reverts focus to the next client in the stacking 
    order).
  * Made a small change in appearance of unfocused windows. The line which 
    separates the small box in the right corner is not painted. Its only painted 
    on a focused window now.
  * Changed back the code which initially maps a window. I though withdrawn 
    windows shouldn't be mapped. I think I am confused =) Withdrawn windows 
    will now be mapped initially.
  * Changed default focus model to sloppy.
  * Got rid of -arch=686 in appbar's and setrootimages Makefiles.

1.0.16-RC1 (26 Jan 2002)

  * Added in David Lawrence Ramsey's hyperbolic gradient patch. This is added
    to appbar and to setrootimage.

1.0.16-pre11 (20 Jan 2002)

  * Changed the fork function in misc.cc to check the length of the
    command to execute if its zero length then obviously don't fork 
    anything.
  * Hopefully squashed the bug which would cause aewm++ to lock up.
  * Badly needed updates to the manpage.
  * There are only 2 command line options to execute commands via button clicks
    they are -new1 and -new2 which coorespond to the left and right mouse buttons
    respectively. This is the best compromise I can come up with and still have
    the middle button pop up the icon menu.
  * Fixed -fn option. The user select font was not being used for unfocused
    windows.

1.0.16-pre10 (18 Jan 2002)

  * Fixes to LinkedListIterator
  * Iconifying clients with transients will correctly iconify all transients
    and vice versa.
  * Minor updates to appbar so that it disables always on top hint and strut
    when hidden.

1.0.16-pre9 (15 Jan 2002)

  * Merged in David Lawrence Ramsey's patch which fixes typos in the man page,
    Changelog and in windowmanager.cc.
  * Code cleanup, got rid of DEBUG code. It was hardly ever used anyway.
  * Clean up in client move code.
  * Window manager keeps track of the command line which started the window manager
    upon restart the same command line is used.
	
1.0.16-pre8 (13 Jan 2002)

  * More work on focus issues. Should be just about right now!
  * -fm click|sloppy|follow are the commandline options for focus model.

1.0.16-pre7 (12 Jan 2002)

  * Updated the commandline option -usage.
  * More clean ups in windowmanager.cc.

1.0.16-pre6 (12 Jan 2002)

  * Merged in David Lawrence Ramsey's focus policy patch. Seems pretty
    close to the code in pre5 however we will go with his.
  * Fixed problem with focus when switching desktops with the key combos.

1.0.16-pre5 (3 Jan 2002)

  * Initial support for sloppy focus and click to focus and configurable
    from the command line.

1.0.16-pre4 (31 Dec 2001)
 
  * Initial configuration handlers for sloppy focus, click to focus and
    focus follows mouse added but commented out.
  * Added LOOKING_FOR_HELP file which describes that this project is
    in need of help it provides contact information.

1.0.16-pre3 (29 Dec 2001)

  * Added a patch which changes the fspanel to have buttons for virtual
    desktops instead of arrows. I can't remember who sent me this patch. If
    it was you email me so I can give you credit.

1.0.16-pre2 (29 Dec 2001)
 
  * Updates to setrootimage in goodies subdirectory. It now takes advantage
    of all of the style options provided by the blackbox image code.

1.0.16-pre1 (29 Dec 2001)

  * Got rid of compile time option NET, the extended hints are compiled
    in automatically. There is no reason not to have them as they don't
    rely on any external libs or anything.
  * Some clean up in client.cc.
  * Clean ups in man page.




** OLDER JUNK WAS OMITTED **
