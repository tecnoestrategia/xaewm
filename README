	XAEWM A MODIFICATION OF AEWM++ BY XENTO FIGAL 2003

======================================================================

Este gestor de x-window es una modificacioin del codigo original de 
aewm++ y este a su vez en aewm, ambos readme estan en este documento


Lo primero seria preguntarse el porque otro gestor casi igual a muchos parecidos,
bien la respuesta es sencilla: ¿ por que no?

En linux tenemos esa ventaja, ademas el codigo abierto nos permite adaptar el
software para nuestras necesidades.

Lo unico que aporta este gestor es un menu personalizable, al mas puro estilo
practico, es un sencillo script de tan solo 5.2 Kb para no perder la linea
de este gestor: "lo minimo de espacio lo minimo de recursos".

No he puesto el menu por si solo, por que realmente es absurdo, pero ya puestos
como cambie alguna linea de codigo por problemas de versiones etc,, 

Al final tenia un gestor que si bien no estaba escrito por mi al 100% yo tan
solo he cambiado un 1% del codigo original de aewm++ pero restructurar todo
me llevo algunas horas de trabajo, y como aqui muchas veces lo que usamos
unos nos va muy bien a otros, y con solo 50kb de codigo, no creo que colapse
mucho ancho de banda, aqui esta xaewm.

======================================================================

El menu actua cuando pulsamos el 3 boton del raton, en la version de aewm++ se
abria una terminal (xterm) en este caso se muestra el menu.

El menu permite introducir entradas en un archivo (/usr/share/xaewm/menu.data)
y ejecutar comandos asociados a la entrada, y definidos en el mismo archivo.

P.ejem

%Ejecutar xterm
xterm

%Ejecutar rxvt
rxvt

Por la disposicion del codigo con solo poner el nombre del comando que lanza
otro gestor de x-window xaewm se cerrara y se cambiara al gestor seleccionado.

El menu permite editar entradas, borrarlas y salir de la session de X-window

Se podrian incluir mas cosas, pero estoy luchando contra el consumo y el tamaño
del gestor de ventanas, de todas maneras si algun dia sale adelante un buen
proyecto, se le incluiran mas funcionalidades.


Pocos cambios mas se pueden incluir que actuen de manera practica, la eliminacion 
de alguna opcion que me daba problemas y poco mas, desde luego ejecutando
la opcion para añadir un comando y creando el script ya tendriamos xaewm de
nuevo, pero esta vez lo incluyo como parte del propio codigo , de todas 
maneras esa opcion se mantiene.

aewm++ - The C++ version of aewm
======================================================================

Why was this done?
------------------

This was done for the simple fact that the C version of aewm spawned
many new window managers. In other words it is a great peice of code
in which to hack. Hopefully by having a C++ version of it, it will 
inspire even more C++ programmers to hack it into yet more window managers.

What does it do?
----------------

The C++ version does everything the C version does and more. The programs in 
the goodies directory were discarded. The reason for this is they are obsolete
if you use fspanel and appbar. If you want these programs then download
the aewm source code. In the future I plan on starting my own goodies directory
where I will distribute appbar, and other little goodies to complement aewm++.

aewm++ provides window maximization, iconification, shading and virtual desktops 
in addition to the regular aewm features.

By default aewm++ starts with 4 virtual desktops (or workspaces if you like). 
Switching is done via the page up and page down keys while mouse pointer is over
the root window. You can specify more virtual desktops by passing the 
-md <number of workspaces> to aewm++ at runtime.

aewm++ is designed for a 3 button mouse or a 2 button mouse with 3 button emulation
on.

Window maximization is done by double clicking with the first mouse button on
the titlebar, double clicking on a maximized window restores it to its original
position and size.

Shading a window is done by middle clicking on the titlebar. Do this again and 
the window will become unshaded.

To iconify a window simply press the first mouse button on the little box at the 
right edge of the titlebar. aewm++ doesn't provide any native way to uniconify windows.
If used in conjunction with fspanel it works nicely.

As of version 1.0.13 there is now an icon menu. If you middle click on the root
window you will see the icon menu if you have clients that are iconified. If no
clients are iconified you will see nothing. If you middle click on the root window
again while the menu is open it will hide. Icons for the current desktop are the
only ones that show. Once you switch desktops whatever icons on that desktop will
show.

More features will be added to aewm++ as needed. I want to get it to where all 
the standard things you'd expect in a window manager are supported. The focus
is also to keep aewm++ as lite as possible. It also picks up development where aewm
left off, it hasn't undergone any new development in quite a long time.

Partial GNOME support was added, enough to get aewm++ working fully with fspanel.
I highly recommend using fspanel with aewm++ as it fits together nicely!

Install
-------

tar xvzf aewm++-1.0.x.tar.gz
cd aewm++-1.0.x
make
su
make install

To uninstall do:

make uninstall

Edit your ~/.xinitrc and add:

exec aewm++

aewm - An X11 Window Manager
======================================================================

aewm is a minimalistic window manager for X11. I wrote it mostly to
learn about X and the ICCCM, but also to fight software bloat. Instead
of expanding to fill your entire "desktop environment", aewm's main
purpose is to get out of your way and allow you to use other programs
to control things like menus, icons, backgrounds, cursors, root
backgrounds, and so on.

It doesn't do "themes", or have much in the way of configuration.
This is a philosophical statement; it's better to do your work than
distract yourself with pretty little borders around it. I myself
haven't changed the default background color in, well, ever.

Another goal I had in writing aewm was to create an easily readable
and hackable implementation of the ICCCM. While I'm not 100% there
yet, I think I've at least made the dense jungle of Xlib a bit more
understandable. You are encouraged to take the code and do your own
thing with it. For this reason I chose a liberal license that should
allow you to add your favorite GPL or BSD flavour if you see fit.

I was planning on using the name "swim" (Simple WIndow Manager), but
someone snapped that up while I was getting the code ready for general
consumption. "ae" doesn't really stand for anything, but I am a big
fan of Autechre. ;-)

The latest release is at http://www.red-bean.com/~decklin/aewm/.

Installation
======================================================================

Before compiling, check the default (DEF_foo) options in aewm.h, and
the defines in the Makefile. DEF_FONT is of particular interest; make
sure that it is defined to something that exists on your system. You
can turn -DSHAPE off if you don't have the Shape extension, and
-DMWM_HINTS on if you have the Lesstif or Motif headers installed.

"make" will compile everything, and "make install" will install it.
The goodies/ directory must be compiled separately.

I've decided not to use imake or autoconf because the Makefiles they
generate are nearly impossible to read, and I wanted to learn how to
do it myself. If you need to hack the Makefile in order to get it to
work, please email me so I can take your configuration into account.

Using It
======================================================================

aewm adds a titlebar with a small box on the right to each window.
The availible commands are as follows:

    Button  Titlebar  Box
    ------  --------  --------
    1       Raise     Hide
    2       Move      Resize
    3       Lower     Delete

Each button will also start a different program when you click on the
root window. These programs can be defined with the -new1, -new2, and
-new3 options.

aewm places new windows based on the position of the mouse. If your
mouse is in the center of the the screen, a new window will be
centered; as you move the mouse to a side or corner, the position of
the window will move there.

Please note that there is no `unhide' operation to undo the `hide'
operation. You'll need one of the goodies for that.

Goodies
======================================================================

The goodies directory has been deleted. All of the default aewm goodies
have been deleted. If you want them download aewm source code. The
reason for this is because I don't plan on changing any of them so its 
redundant to include them here.

In the future a new goodies directory will be created with my own programs
to complement aewm++.

Caveats
======================================================================

aewm is really not meant for 2-button mice. If you are stuck with one,
make sure you can emulate a third button by chording, and try running
xmodmap -e 'pointer = 1 3 2'. This will make your right button be #2,
and a chord #3. I have a few 3 button mice lying around so you can
always ask me to mail you one. ;-)

The Makefiles may cause problems with non-GNU or out-of-date versions
of make. If you have problems, try upgrading first, or just
substituting `gmake' for `make'.

Acknowledgements
======================================================================

In case this sounds familiar, it is. This project would have been
nearly impossible without the greatly appreciated work of David Hogan
on 9wm, which I based my design on. I can't thank him enough.

> The latest version of 9wm is held at ftp://ftp.cs.su.oz.au/dhog/9wm.
> 9wm was written by David Hogan (dhog@cs.su.oz.au), a postgraduate

Thanks to Christophe Tronche for HTML-ifying the ICCCM and other
essential X documentation (http://www.tronche.com/gui/x/).

Adam Sampson <azz@gnu.org> wrote the initial code for MWM hints and
menu-ified goodies.
